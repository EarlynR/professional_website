### A Little About Me

I love Data Science, with my first love being Statistics. I was introduced to it in college, and, until recently, has been one of the few things that has maintained my interest for so long. But now that I am pursing an M.S. degree in Data Science at Johns Hopkins, my love for math is growing, and I know it will only grow from here. <br>

While I was at Galvanize, I learned numerous algorithms: Random forests, gradient boosting machines, multi-arm bandits, MLP, and so much more. It's fair to say that all these algorithms are intriguing and many have helped tremendously at SelectQuote. Though I did not learn everything there is in the field - which I think is nearly impossible due to the sheer volume of information - SelectQuote has given me the opportunity to learn new things, all of which I am grateful for.  This includes ARIMA models, LSTMs, Firth Regression, and cat2vecs to name a few.  

My love for programming is growing as well; fortunately so because it is such a big part of my job at SelectQuote. Now, I have some formal training in Computer Science, but I will have the opportunity to deep dive into Comp. Sci with classes like Data Structures, Foundations for Algorithms, and Database Management.<br>

In a nutshell, I have my dream job, and I can't imagine being happy doing anything else. Naturally, I have some career aspirations, the most immediate one is to become a Data Science Manager.  <br>
