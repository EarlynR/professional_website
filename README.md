## My Professional Website 

This repository contains all information that is fed to my professional website: earlynr.github.io. 

To create my website, I used Hugo's [tranquilpeak theme](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) written by Louis Barranqueiro and Thibaud Lepretre, with inspiration from Robin Hu's [website](https://github.com/robinfhu/personal-site). Huge thanks to all of them. 

To test the site locally, type in the command line: 
hugo server 

Any modifications to the site can be made to the html files or the config.toml file.
